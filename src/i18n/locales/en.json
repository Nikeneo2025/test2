    "nitrogen": "Nitrogen is a primary macronutrient essential for plant growth, particularly for lush, leafy growth and overall vigor. It is a key component of chlorophyll, the molecule responsible for photosynthesis, and is also necessary for the formation of amino acids, proteins, and enzymes. Adequate nitrogen ensures strong vegetative growth and high yields.",
    "phosphorus": "Phosphorus is crucial for energy transfer within the plant, playing a vital role in photosynthesis, respiration, and nutrient uptake. It is particularly important for root development, flowering, fruiting, and seed formation. Adequate phosphorus promotes early maturity, improves crop quality, and enhances disease resistance.",
    "potassium": "Potassium, often called the 'quality nutrient,' is essential for overall plant health, water regulation, and disease resistance. It activates many enzymes involved in various plant processes, including protein synthesis and sugar transport. Adequate potassium improves fruit quality, increases drought tolerance, and strengthens plant stems.",
    "ph": "Soil pH is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity, and it profoundly affects nutrient availability. Most crops thrive within a specific pH range (typically slightly acidic to neutral, 6.0-7.0) because this range optimizes the solubility and uptake of essential nutrients by plant roots.",
    "ec": "Electrical Conductivity (EC) measures the total concentration of dissolved salts in the soil, which is directly related to the amount of dissolved nutrients. A favorable EC range indicates adequate nutrient levels without causing salinity stress. High EC can cause osmotic stress, hindering water and nutrient uptake by plants.",
    "humidity": "Although not a soil parameter, ambient humidity significantly impacts crop yield by affecting plant transpiration and water uptake. Optimal humidity levels reduce water loss through leaves, prevent wilting, and promote efficient nutrient transport."
